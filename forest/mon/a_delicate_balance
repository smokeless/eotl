This old growth mushroom forest is preserved in a delicate balance.
The decay angels clean up the forest floor, maintaining the ground
and preventing too much moss build up. If too much moss builds up it will
dry out. If the moss dries out, it's possible for a massive fire to start.
The fire will not destroy the forest itself but it will burn all the smaller
things.

The various beasts found roaming the forest provide compost for
the younger mushrooms to sprout up from.

In turn the slimes leave fertilizer in their trails. Producing a necessary
moisture level.

Banshees keep the werewolves in check. Werewolves keep the slimes in check.
Slimes keep the banshees in check.
