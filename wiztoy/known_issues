Uses absolute path. That's an issue. Probably will upgrade to
setting a dir to edit in, eliminating that problem.

OMG I just used it and now there's errors everywhere.
You aren't in the directory of the room you're starting
the zapper in. This will be fixed if I add a path
setting.

WTF are these .bak files? I'm planning on implementing
an undo function.

Why is this code secure? Because it's easier for me
to properly maintain it, and I can log the usage
better that way.

It doesn't have x,y axis awareness? It might in the future.

It lags when I goto the void? It has a built in lag function
to allow the driver to catch up in the destruct/load/clone.
