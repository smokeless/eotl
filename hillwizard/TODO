Arphen tells you: my vision is more like, you're resting...
Arphen tells you: and you use the skill
Arphen tells you: and then it increases your mana regen, and then it lasts

Tell Arphen. . .
You tell Arphen: I think an object could check on heartbeat if the player is

Arphen tells you: so if you have 10 skill, you have to sit here and really
                spam it to get regen going
Arphen tells you: and if you have 50 skill, you can tab out while it does
                work
