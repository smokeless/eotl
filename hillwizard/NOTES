                      Hill Wizard Guild Idea
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hill Wizards are simple folk who stumbled upon magic by happenstance.
They are Fighters who began to recognize that certain elaborate movements
of their bodies would result in magical effects.  They're not very smart,
so they don't exactly know how this all works, nor do they really care.
Their magic is a result of sheer willpower, and the agility to perform
these elegant maneuvers in combat situations.  As a result of a general
lack of knowledge on this subject, a lack of incantations being recited,
a lack of focusing for several rounds to cast spells, the outcomes of
their spells can vary wildly, occasionally to the point of absurdity.
The spells Hill Wizards cast are primarily connected to four schools
of magic: magic (arcane), magic_fire, magic_elec, and magic_cold.
Other types of magic are too advanced and complicated.

They focus on light weaponry, as it enables them to utilize their magic
shields, the source of their power.  Summoning a magic shield is a mighty
feat, but once they figured out this step, the rest of things just sorta
fell into place.

Shield blocks with their magic shield consume a portion of mana, and award
one Freedom Magic point.  If they lack sufficient mana to sustain the shield
being hit, the shield disintegrates and a new one must then be summoned.

Freedom Magic is a resource, capped at 5.  These points can be spent to
cast a variety of guild skills.  Some skills may cost more points than
others.

Requirements to join: 150 wil, 150 dex, 35 shield   (?)

This is essentially a warrior mage guild with a redneck theme, and focuses
on shield related combat.  The guild will be housed in Hillbilly Cabal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freedom Magic:  

The primary resource of the guild.  This will be displayed everytime the
player is hit, similar to Charge for capacitors and Force Power for Padawan.

The resource is capped at 5, to promote players to use these charges rather
than save them for certain situations.  Hill Wizards don't think ahead, they
just do magic, because magic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summon Shield:

This spell summons a magic buckler for the player to use.  The shield has a
weight of 0, and cannot be dropped, given away, or sold.

Blocks with the shield cost a chunk of mana, and award a Freedom Magic point.

Attempted blocks without the required amount of mana will shatter the shield,
inflicting damage to everyone in the room, especially the wearer.  A new 
shield can easily be resummoned.  Casting the spell will consume 100% of
your mana pool.  This is the only spell Hill Wizards cast that directly 
costs mana, and it is the only real magic they have knowledge of.

Higher levels of this skill provide additional benefits.  For example, 
additional resistances, ac, reflective damage, defensive level bonuses, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blockade:

This skill, when trained to 1, will convert all dodges performed by
Hill Wizards into blocks.  This will let dodge remain relevant, while
generating more Freedom Magic points as well.

Higher levels of blockade will also increase the block chance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Think 'bout Stuff:

This spell allows a Hill Wizard to regain mana at a much faster rate than
normal resting.  At higher levels, it also has a chance on heartbeat to
restore a Freedom Magic point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cook Meth:

Methamphetamine is a powerful performance enhancing drug, utilized only
by Hill Wizards.  Anyone not in this specialization will receive a
message, something like "You have too much common sense to use this,"
or "Meth: not even once."  Alternatively, consumption will not provide
non-Hill Wizards with a buff, but just inflict damage and reduce stats.
Hill Wizards who attempt to consume meth not cooked by them will receive
a message like "You don't trust what you don't cook."

When you consume your own meth, you gain a buff to your str, dex, and crit.
Higher levels may also effect other stats.

Meth can only be cooked in a Hill Wizard meth lab, and will require some 
coins to handle the costs of the materials.  This should be streamlined,
rather than requiring every ingredient individually.  You're just paying
for the use of the lab, and the materials are provided by the lab.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wizardy Smash - Cost: 1 Freedom Magic

This combat attack ability is performed with the equipped melee weapon, 
but the nature of the strike is magical.  The damage dealt from this
attack will be fairly low, perhaps even zero for less skilled players,
but will lower the victim's magical resistances.  At lower levels (0-19) it
will only reduce one magical school.  20-29 will reduce two schools, 30-39
will reduce three schools, and 40+ will reduce all four spell schools.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sling Spell - Cost: 3 Freedom Magic

This is the primary damage dealing spell for the Hill Wizard guild.  The spell
requires 3 Freedom Magic points to cast, but has a chance to consume up to all
5.  When this overload ocurrs, bonus damage will be dealt, but this effect is
entirely random, and uneffected by higher skill levels.  This results in a
fairly random, uncontrollable feeling of the spell, while ensuring it is always
worth casting.

The spell selects a random damage type from the four schools of Hill Wizardy:
Magic (Arcane), Fire Magic, Frozen Magic, Electrical Magic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Barrier - Cost: X Freedom Magic (set # in balance pass)

Create a magical barrier to surround the caster.  A successful cast will
summon a magical damage absorption on the caster, eating a set amount
of damage, determined by skill and stat levels.  You take zero damage
while the shield holds, as damage is dealt into the shield instead.

There are two failure casts on this spell.  A hard fail will have no effect,
other than consuming Freedom Magic, but a secondary failure will create a
lesser form of damage absorption shield, where damage taken is redirected
into their mana and fatigue pools.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wind Whip - Cost: 1 Freedom Magic

This is a utility spell, however its usefulness is lowered by its random
nature.  A successful spell cast will randomly select one of these three
effects:  Disarm, Trip (Delay), or Damage.  The player has no control over
which effect takes place, and higher skill levels do not change the odds.
Skill level will effect overall success of the spell, the second disarm
saving roll, trip delay duration, or damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windprisonment - Cost 2 Freedom Magic

Successful casts spawn a circular wall of wind around the victim.  The
winds reduce offensive and defensive bonuses, lower dodge chance, dex,
and inhibit fleeing both as a flee skill reduction, and by actively forcing
fleeing windprisoned players to hit a saving roll.

High levels of the skill may also reduce damage dealt.  Check on balance pass.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Twister - Passive, always on.

Capped at 1, this passive spell will be very expensive, in the ballpark 
of 250 million.  When trained, a tornado of magic surrounds the caster.
Which type of magic surrounds the caster is selected at random, between 
the four schools of Hill Wizardry.  When you are struck in combat, some
damage is dealt to the attacker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proficiencies:

As a specialization of the Fighter guild, Hill Wizards will have access to
essentially every proficiency type at an already relatively low cost.  However,
to emphasize the use of light, one handed weapons, all light proficiency types,
in addition to hands and knife prof, will be set just slightly cheaper than
in the guild itself.
