A lot of this will not make sense. But
living.doc I wrote before I was wizzed. It will be very helpful.
The Devo txt is helpful about frob stuff. You won't have to get it 100%
but make an effort.
note.c Is how I would like to see things formatted.
There are other files here, ls -a to see them. The ones with the . infront
go in your home dir.

You will be spending a lot of time in ed. So man ed.
The main things you will want to know about ed are, a to append,
c to change a line, d to delete a line, z to scroll lines. It's
a pain in the ass. So write your code in notepad++ then upload it
via your client. Which I am assuming is something sensible like
MUSHclient. In MUSHclient you can cntrl-shift-v and mass paste.
If you have a mud client though I assume it has something like
that included.


The tadji list is for your tadji. They're just cool little wiz functions.
You can spend some time figuring them out. Don't do anything stupid. I
think I included Cycle and some other dangerous ones. There are hundreds
and hundreds out there. I've got a very small .tadji list compared to
a lot. More than most though. These are the ones I have found to be
the most useful. stat will pry be the one you use the most.

goto will take you to a player object. Trans will transport them
to you.

That should help get you started.


Oh, and ps. I copied a toy I made awhile back for you to look at.
It's not the best example of code. But it does some interesting
things.

Also alias clone to clone -s, load to load -s, ed to ed -s, dest to dest -s.
The spam from that is really annoying and most people don't want to see
it.
