Witches are a skill based spell caster spec.
Witches become worse as certain stats raise.
Chr - It's hard for a witch to strike the proper horror and fear
and all that jazz looking like a beauty queen.
str - those bulky muscles get in the way of doing witch stuff
con - in order to be a gross witch monster you should probably
be somewhat sickly.

Concept is to force players to balance around survivability
and power.
