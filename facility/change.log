Oh my god, fix the damned it's/its errors.  They're driving me insane.

After going back and changing descs, and moving things around they
should all be fixed. Hopefully. If I missed one let me know.

In your code, NoTeleportP should always be sufficient to block that type of
movement.  NoTeleportOutP and NoTeleportInP are really only for if you want
to block one but not the other.

Thanks for the heads up will be fixing it as I run across it.

the description of the high level researcher is boring and uninformative.  Is
he tall, short, purple hair, blue hair, bald, etc etc.  The information
contained is fine, but just seriously lacking.

Both high and mid researchers should be much more interesting.

/usr/socialism/room/outside*.c
Report:
I find the description in this room confusing.  The barricade
is to the south, but there are unexplained exits to the east 
and north.  The first line is not written well, and there is no
indication of directionality for the facility.  Also, the 
description of the barricade says that it blocks all physical 
access to the facility, and yet if you go north, you are in the
lobby of the facility with no indication that you did anything 
but walk.

Fixed descriptions. Clarified information.

/usr/socialism/facility/obj/display.c
Thoughts:
You can look at display but you can't look at 
doll or board.  In the switch have it set_ids() 
to the specific item.

ids not set to specific item.

/usr/socialism/facility/obj/note
I don't know for sure but Post-It is a proper noun.
add a read language check for flavour? 

This note is now tastier than ever. Players will
now have two different meanings taken from the
note. Depending on whether or not they have trained
read language.

/usr/socialism/facility/room/pit.c
So, a player falls down in the pit and dies.  
But, what if they don't die (amulet of salvation 
or some other item) or they end up as a ghost.  
Now what do they do?  it seems that the only option 
is to quit.

Due to the continous expansion of the Eternal sewer
system, an intrepid worker broke through into the pit.
The worker was never found, and the pipeline disconnected.
However as it a very large pipe, players may now
escape the pit by crawling out through it.

/usr/socialism/facility/room/basement
thoughts: 
Line 49 needs a litle adjusting
When you enter the room Skelaf says a statement. In 
this statement he says 'Just go ahead and leap in'

Why did you add set("reset_data") with nothing in it.

Good question. Removed.

/usr/socialism/facility/room/office
Thoughts:
Nice auto attacking code.  No warning though if 
you go in that direction they will attack you.  
Could add something to the long that there is a 
guard station or give a player a warning before 
auto.  Also they auto when you peer

Fluffius still attacks on peer, as it is a
violation of company policy to even view this
area. Fluffius is now clearer about his intent
guarding the exit. Due to a myriad of law suits
Facility 31 working closely with OSHA has installed
a warning sign to release themselves from liability.


/usr/socialism/facility/room/lobby
Thoughts:
There are multiple ways in this room for objects 
to get cloned.  Like in the museum you might want 
to add a way to restrict a player from having 
multiples of the same item.

Players will no longer lug around piles and
piles of notes and pamphlets.

museum.c

Descriptions:
The two way mirror on the east wall has a pretty 
weird description.  Why are players trying to see 
beyond the mirror?  how do they know it is a two 
way mirror?  can't they see their ugly asses?

Description fixed, players will now get an ego
bump about their sexiness.

You added the action 'clean museum' for players 
to gain a key card.  You might want to add 
something to restrict them from having multiple 
key cards. Like a simple if(
present_clone(FOBJ"keycardf", THISP)
or something.
        
Players will no longer be able to get extra
keycards.

Are there clues anywhere to suggest that I "clean museum"?  
If so, I missed them.

Bimpni will mention that she would like someone to clean the 
museum as part of her monstertalk. I could up the frequency
of this if you would like.

Report:
The board syntax is kinda awkward, and when I do something 
wrong (like type "write something") I get the error message 
writeon what?  with no space

Board now uses write on board to write on it. "writeon" is 
now "Write on"

Report:
I know I'm not really geared up, but this fluffius character 
is pretty hard for an eval 30-50 area

He is somewhat of an eval check, if you want I'll tone him
down. I just didn't want players getting through the area
too quickly then not being able to xp the second half of it.

Report:
Door gives lots of errors, probably another case of 
interference from replace_program.  Don't replace_program

No more replace program.

'A gust of hot air rises from the pit.' message is not respecting

Report:
When I search the room (not that I had any clue to do so other than reading
the code) I get the "You peer through..." etc message, but then I also get
the 'Dorf roots around..." message too.

There is now a hint to search included, and tell_room is working
properly.

Report:
I get a big ole error message when I push the button... probably because in
the push() function of the well you have  string hero =
THISP->query_real_name()  and then later you do  hero->set(
"facility_phase_2", 1 )  as if the 'hero' variable were an object and not a
string.

This is now fixed.

Report:
It's a little harsh to drop a buncha hints to jump down the well, and then
kill the player for doing so.  But funny.

I think it's harsh, but the player should be low enough eval to recover
quickly. Also, I feel that the hints are pretty clearly telling the player
that the well is full dead souls.

Report:
Also, it took a while for me to figure out the syntax for jumping.  "Jump in
well" and variations didn't work.

Syntax for wells is now fixed.

Report:
The only way out of this room is to quit out?

The only time a player should ever be in this pit
is if they are dead. I could add an additional exit
if needs be.

Report:
Seems like the well provides a never-ending supply of xp fodder?

Well is now fixed to limit xp fodder.
