You said: ?
You said: That is my thought.
Poi said: well, you as the person aren't relevant there
Poi said: in time_attack
You said: well who ever walks through.
Poi said: anyways
Poi said: when i saw this error
You said: I've seen it come up a few times.
You said: In different mobs.
Poi said: i didn't really look what it actually was
Poi said: i assumed that it was the call_out to time_attack not being removed
          if the mob died
Poi said: but that actually happens in the destruct_signal
Poi said: there are 2 other call_outs done in create() though
Poi said: that don't get removed if the mob dies
You said: ok
--> Poi says: which means this error can only happen with a freshly cloned mob
          dies withinn 1-5 seconds
'Oh.
